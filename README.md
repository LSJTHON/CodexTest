# Calculator App

This simple calculator separates frontend and backend functionality.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

The backend exposes a `/calculate` endpoint that evaluates arithmetic expressions sent from the frontend.
